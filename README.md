# INTEGRATE - Benchmarking Metagenomic and Metatranscriptomic Sequencing for Gastrointestinal Pathogen Detection

## Overview
Infectious intestinal disease (or acute gastroenteritis) affects an estimated 18 million individuals annually in the UK. Traditional diagnostic methods, including culture, microscopy, and antigen detection, often lack the sensitivity and speed required for timely and accurate pathogen identification. While PCR-based assays have improved sensitivity, PCR-based assays are limited to known targets and may miss unexpected or novel pathogens.​

[This work](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.03.23288067v2) systematically evaluates the diagnostic potential of metagenomic (DNA) and metatranscriptomic (RNA) sequencing in detecting community-acquired gastrointestinal pathogens in the United Kingdom. Our study benchmarked these advanced sequencing methods across 1,067 patients against traditional clinical diagnostics, aiming to enhance pathogen surveillance and outbreak detection.​

## Key findings include:​

- Metatranscriptomics demonstrated increased sensitivity in detecting pathogens such as _Campylobacter_, _Clostridioides difficile_, _Cryptosporidium_, and _Giardia_.​

- Metagenomics was more effective for identifying Adenovirus, pathogenic _Escherichia coli_, _Salmonella_, _Shigella_, and _Yersinia enterocolitica_.​

- Certain pathogens were detectable by both methods, highlighting their complementary nature.​

- Metatranscriptomics provided near-complete genome coverage for _Salmonella_ and Human mastadenovirus F40/F41, and detected _Cryptosporidium_ via capture of _Cryptosporidium parvum_ virus (CSpV1).​

- Ratios of pathogen reads (RNA to DNA) can differentiate between positive and negative samples.
